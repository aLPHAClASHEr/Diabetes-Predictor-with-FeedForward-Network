# Diabetes-Predictor-with-FeefForward-Network
This repository predicts whether the person has diabetes or not with the help of Dense Neural Network Model

Here I have used tensorflow.keras to make a Dense Neural Network with 2 hidden layers with 16 neorons each made by 'relu' fucntion type.
The Activation Function is made by 'sigmoid' function.
It predicts whether the person has Diabetes or not using BackPropagation .
